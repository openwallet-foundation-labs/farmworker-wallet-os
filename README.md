# Farmworker Wallet OS

The Farmworker Wallet OS is a solution framework built to jumpstart the integration of digital trust technologies with the [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com/) low-code application platform. The framework 
makes it easy for any Mendix app to interoperate with open-standard technologies like [decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), [DIDComm](https://didcomm.org), and [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).
